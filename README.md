# K-Nearest-Neighbor
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, non-parametric supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It predicts the output of a new data point based on the majority class (classification) or average value (regression) of its k closest neighbors in the feature space.
